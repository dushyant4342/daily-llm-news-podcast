AI Tutorials
We've been stuck in text-based AI interfaces for too long. Sure, they work, but they're not the most natural way humans communicate. Now, with OpenAI's new Agents SDK and their recent text-to-speech models, we can build voice applications without drowning in complexity or code.
In this tutorial, we'll build a
Multi-agent Voice RAG
system that speaks its answers aloud. We'll create a multi-agent workflow where specialized AI agents handle different parts of the process - one agent focuses on processing documentation content, another optimizes responses for natural speech, and finally OpenAI's text-to-speech model delivers the answer in a human-like voice.
Our RAG app uses
OpenAI Agents SDK
to create and orchestrate these agents that handle different stages of the workflow. OpenAI’s new speech model GPT-4o-mini TTS enhances the overall user experience with a natural, emotion-rich voice. You can easily steer its voice characteristics like the tone, pacing, emotion, and personality traits with simple natural language instructions.
We share hands-on tutorials like this every week, designed to help you stay ahead in the world of AI.
If you're serious about leveling up your AI skills and staying ahead of the curve, subscribe now and be the first to access our latest tutorials.

Vibe Code Your MCP Server
is a comprehensive platform to create, deploy, manage, and discover MCP servers. It removes the infrastructure headaches typically associated with running Model Context Protocol servers. Flow comes with a
no-code MCP Studio
, where you can vibe code MCP servers via a chat interface, publish on GitHub, and deploy them on Flow Cloud with a few clicks.
The platform provides straightforward integration with Claude, Cursor IDE, and offers client libraries for both Python and JavaScript applications.
Key Highlights:
Develop and Test
- Build MCP servers by describing requirements in natural language. The commands can be as simple as “Create an MCP server for iMDB using the following documentation «link». Once a server is created, you can inspect and validate it instantly with MCP’s Inspector tool.
Deploy Anywhere
- Publish your server directly to GitHub with one click, or instantly deploy to Flow Cloud without worrying about infrastructure setup. Simply select your deployment target and Flow handles the rest. Over 1,000 servers are already running on the platform.
Easy integration with Clients
- Connect servers to Claude with a simple URL command, add to Cursor IDE through the MCP settings panel, or use client libraries for programmatic access using Python and JavaScript.
Standard communication protocol
- Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for consistent communication between LLMs and MCP servers across different environments.

Build and Deploy Production-Grade AI Agents Visually
Lamatic.ai
is a fully managed PaaS providing a complete environment for building, deploying, and monitoring AI agents with a visual, low-code interface. The platform allows you to create AI agents by connecting modular nodes on a drag-and-drop interface, integrating data sources and models, and deploying to a serverless edge environment as GraphQL APIs or widgets - all while providing detailed observability tools to ensure reliable performance.
The goal is faster development and reduced operational overhead, deploying in under 60 seconds.
Key Highlights:
Low-Code Visual Builder
- Create sophisticated AI flows by connecting pre-built nodes in an intuitive interface. Teams can collaborate directly in the Studio environment with role-based permissions.
Seamless Connections
- Connect to various data sources, AI models, and third-party applications through drag-and-drop functionality. The platform handles authentication and integration complexities.
Edge Deployment
- Deploy your AI agents to a serverless edge environment in under a minute. Your applications are exposed as GraphQL APIs or embeddable widgets, with the platform handling scaling automatically while cutting response latency in half.
Real-Time Observability
- Monitor agent performance with detailed request logs, real-time tracing, and comprehensive usage reports. This visibility helps identify and fix issues quickly, ensuring your AI applications maintain high reliability in production.
Quick Bites
OpenAI has rolled out an updated version of GPT-4o
in ChatGPT featuring enhanced instruction-following abilities, better handling of technical challenges, and improved creativity. The update is immediately available for all paid subscribers, while free users will gain access over the coming weeks.
Google has made its latest reasoning model Gemini 2.5 Pro available to all free users
. It also integrates with Canvas on the
Gemini app
. This is HUGE! The model tops the LMArena leaderboard, and Google giving this level of intelligence to everyone is a game-changer for AI accessibility.
Anthropic has published two new papers on the inner workings of Claude
. Using their "AI microscope" approach, they discovered that the model thinks in a universal language across different tongues, plans poetry rhymes several words in advance, and sometimes engages in motivated reasoning rather than faithful step-by-step thinking. These findings provide rare insights into how LLMs actually process information beneath the surface.
Tools of the Trade
MCP Link
: Converts OpenAPI specifications into Model Context Protocol servers without modifying the original API code. It bridges existing web APIs with AI agents by generating fully-functional MCP interfaces that maintain all the original API endpoints and features.
Awesome MCP Servers
: A curated repository of over 2,500 MCP server implementations across domains like AI, business management, communication, and development tools.
Open Responses
: A self-hosted, open-source alternative to OpenAI's Responses API that works with any LLM backend, allowing you to use models like Claude, Qwen, and Deepseek R1 instead of being limited to OpenAI's models.
Awesome LLM Apps
: Build awesome LLM apps with RAG, AI agents, and more to interact with data sources like GitHub, Gmail, PDFs, and YouTube videos, and automate complex work.

We've been stuck in text-based AI interfaces for too long. Sure, they work, but they're not the most natural way humans communicate. Now, with OpenAI's new Agents SDK and their recent text-to-speech models, we can build voice applications without drowning in complexity or code.
In this tutorial, we'll build a
Multi-agent Voice RAG
system that speaks its answers aloud. We'll create a multi-agent workflow where specialized AI agents handle different parts of the process - one agent focuses on processing documentation content, another optimizes responses for natural speech, and finally OpenAI's text-to-speech model delivers the answer in a human-like voice.
Our RAG app uses
OpenAI Agents SDK
to create and orchestrate these agents that handle different stages of the workflow. OpenAI’s new speech model GPT-4o-mini TTS enhances the overall user experience with a natural, emotion-rich voice. You can easily steer its voice characteristics like the tone, pacing, emotion, and personality traits with simple natural language instructions.
We share hands-on tutorials like this every week, designed to help you stay ahead in the world of AI.
If you're serious about leveling up your AI skills and staying ahead of the curve, subscribe now and be the first to access our latest tutorials.

OpenAI has rolled out an updated version of GPT-4o
in ChatGPT featuring enhanced instruction-following abilities, better handling of technical challenges, and improved creativity. The update is immediately available for all paid subscribers, while free users will gain access over the coming weeks.
Google has made its latest reasoning model Gemini 2.5 Pro available to all free users
. It also integrates with Canvas on the
Gemini app
. This is HUGE! The model tops the LMArena leaderboard, and Google giving this level of intelligence to everyone is a game-changer for AI accessibility.
Anthropic has published two new papers on the inner workings of Claude
. Using their "AI microscope" approach, they discovered that the model thinks in a universal language across different tongues, plans poetry rhymes several words in advance, and sometimes engages in motivated reasoning rather than faithful step-by-step thinking. These findings provide rare insights into how LLMs actually process information beneath the surface.
